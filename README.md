#Lenda's Coding Challenge

##Assignment:

1. Create 3 input boxes and a button.
2. When the button is clicked, a loading/processing screen shows for 5 seconds
3. After 5 seconds, a message appears stating: 'You have been approved!'.

##My Approach:

1. At first, as I decided how to build the form I will spend some time looking at the style guide and Lenda's website to determine if there is an existing pattern for forms.(30min)

2. I will then look at some interesting animations and forms on the web to come up with a great design.  

3. I will also try to make this site responsive so I'll need to take into account resizing the screen for a mobile device.

4. For performance reasons, I will rely heavily on animations and transitions using CSS. Also, I will create a separate file for CSS vs. writing inline styles to allow the browser to cache the styles.css.

5. Considering this form is going to take user's inputs, I will have to add validation to the input fields so I have to determine how I'm going to do that. At first I thought about using a framework like Angular.js to use its validations but decided to simple use a jQuery plugin instead for performance reasons.

6. Part of this assignment is to deliver a great user experience, so I will try to use colors and animations like a progress bar to indicate expected interaction.
